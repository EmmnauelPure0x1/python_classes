# Python Classes

### What is a class?

- Classes provide a means of bundling up data and functionality together. 
- A class is a collection of functions and methods.
- Classes are blueprints. 
- Classes are used to define particular objects. 

### OOP - Object Oriented Programming
#### There are four Pillars
- Inheritance: `
    - ```The mechanism of basing an object or class on another object.``` 
    - ```An object created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties and behaviours of the "parent object/class".```

- Encapsulation: 
    - ```binding of data and the functions that manipulate the data.``` 
    - ```this technique encourages decoupling because it prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.```

- Abstraction: 
    - ```To handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. ```
     - ```Enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity. ```

- Polymorphism:
    - ```Defines instances of many different classes related by some common superclass```
